In UCCS history, there has never been a time when there are so few student jobs available in our community. Our working students face a very difficult time. UCCS, unlike some other universities, is not cutting scholarships. However, hundreds of our students report they have lost their community jobs, many of which were in business sectors hit hardest including restaurants, retail and the tourism industry.\nAs long-standing faculty members, we ask you join us now in supporting scholarships for these deserving students so they can return and attend UCCS in Fall 2020. No gift is too small. This is our time to build a special legacy for the future.\"\n\nDr. Peg Bacon\nJacqueline R. Berning, PhD, RD, CSSD\nR. (Dan) Dandapani, Ph.D.\nJeffery M.

In recent decades documentation of the archaeological record has expanded exponentially. This is creating opportunities for archaeology to contribute to a fundamental science of human society that transcends the past and present and charts a course toward a more secure and just future. The CCSA is striving to make this vision a reality by funding and administering inclusive and interdisciplinary collaborative research, by archaeologists and other social and natural scientists, on issues that face every society. We also work in partnership with the Coalition for Archaeological Synthesis to promote collaborative synthesis in archaeology, and its results, to the archaeological community, other social scientific communities, and policymakers.\n \nThe Center for Collaborative Synthesis in Archaeology support fund is essential for our work—it provides support for maintaining our website, putting on CCSA workshops and events, building and maintaining our global community of interest, and providing opportunities for collaborators with limited resources to participate in our initiatives. \nThis fund also supports our collaboration with the Initiative for Sustainable Development in Africa (ISDAf).  To learn more about the CCSA-hosted meetings in East Africa please click the link below.\nCCSA and ISDAf\nLearn more about the Center for Collaborative Synthesis in Archaeology",

But the world wasn’t quite ready to be saved by development economics. When Professor Robert Stern asked me to be his RA, I switched to international  economics. I learned he traveled internationally; that’s what I wanted to do, this definitely worked out for me!\n“In 1981 I immediately began my career at CU Boulder as an assistant professor. The economics department hired four young international economists. This concentration was important for it convinced the department to build a center of excellence in the field that has lasted to this day. Economics at CU is world famous for its research and teaching in international trade.  Our reputation attracted outstanding graduate students, many of whom became my dissertation advisees and coauthors, plus lifelong friends.\n“My career has been unusual for its devotion to both academic and professional service. It is rare for an academic economist to remain at the same job throughout a career, from assistant professor to retirement and it is highly unusual for a professor to cross boundaries between basic research and policy work. I have devoted considerable time and effort to both.              Academically, that reflects how much I have enjoyed living in Boulder, teaching at CU, and  working with colleagues and students. Most importantly, I spent seven years as the Associate Dean for Social Studies at CU Boulder, a position I enjoyed even with its frustrations. \n“In many ways I feel that I’ve had four careers: teacher, researcher, administrator, and global policy advisor. All were interesting and rewarding and have left me with friends and colleagues throughout the world. It has been an excellent ride.”\n\n\nKeith Maskus, Arts and Sciences Professor of Distinction",

A network of tribal and non-tribal agencies and CU Denver have come together to provide ESIL students with the most current, professionally relevant training to meet the employment needs in this critical area of environmental stewardship.\nLocated in the heart of downtown Denver, CU Denver offers opportunities to intern and work locally and nationally with several tribal and non-tribal environmental organizations, including tribal agencies, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and the State of Colorado.",

To enrich the experience of Jewish Studies students by creating additional mentoring, scholarship, and programming opportunities, please consider becoming a Friend of Jewish Studies with an enhanced gift of $54, or $72.\nFriends will have the opportunity to participate in two exclusive gatherings during the 2021-2022 academic year:\nFall 2021 (Zoom) - Israel, Palestine, and the United States: An Evening of Learning and Conversation with the Jewish Studies Faculty (October 28, 2021 @ 7 pm MT) Friends will join Elias Sacks — Director of the Program in Jewish Studies and Professor of Religious Studies, Hilary Kalisman — Endowed Professor of Israel/Palestine Studies, and Samira Mehta — Professor of American Jewish Studies and Women and Gender Studies for a panel discussion and small group of ‘mini-seminars’ about America and the contemporary Middle East. This program will go beyond the Israel/Palestine Studies film series offered by Jewish Studies to the general public, allowing participants to learn and think with one another, and get a taste of what it’s like to earn a degree in Hebrew/Israel Studies or Jewish Studies at CU.\nSpring 2022 (In-person & Zoom) - Jewish Studies Student Research Showcase (late April, date TBD): Friends will celebrate the work of CU Boulder students pursuing research and creative projects in Jewish Studies, from artistic and musical compositions to original scholarship produced under the mentorship of Jewish Studies faculty. Public-health conditions permitting, the Spring program will take place in-person and will include an option to join and actively participate via Zoom.\nTo learn more about Jewish Studies, visit our webpage. \nTo learn more about the Friends of Jewish Studies, contact Elias Sacks.",
